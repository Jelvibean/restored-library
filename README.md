This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run 'yarn' to tech and install all dependencies necessary for running the application.

## Starting the APP

Run 'yarn dev' once up and running, you should be able to see your app at:
"http://localhost:3000/"

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Helpful Commands:

yarn add <your package>
yarn add <your package> --dev
yarn remove <your package>
yarn build

## Notes on the APP

-I decided to create the project using Nextjs for a few reasons:
Because I am familiar with this environment and like it. ðŸ™‚
Next.js has Babel and Webpack under the hood, so there is no need to worry about explicitly setting them up.

-Next.js offers some cool features Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation, Routing, among other features Iâ€™ve yet to work with.
I could have gone the route of just creating a react project but I would have needed to add Babel and Webpack separately. Plus when it comes to routing, you would need to manage routing manually, and depend on reactRouter for this.

-I installed Yarn in the application. Reasons are because I am used to it and because from my learnings I believe it offers faster installation, reliability, consistency and security.

-Some of the dependencies I decided to add
Eslint, prettier, sass, stylelint, typescript, and yest.
